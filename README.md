# Diamond-Price-Preditction-Project
I'm going to figure out what contributes to the price of a diamond.

# Hypothesis:
It's more than just the carats, cut, or color of a diamond that raises/ lowers the price.

# Step 1: narrow down dataset through querying:
I uploaded a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swatikhedekar/price-prediction-of-diamond) from Kaggle into BigQuery to figure some things out about the data.
The descriptions for each column were lacking once uploaded, so I copy/pasted from the Kaggle page to the descriptions in BQ.
